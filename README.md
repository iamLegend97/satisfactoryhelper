# satisfactoryhelper
A helper for satisfactory calculations

__If you just want to run the program__
1. Run Satisfactory Helper.exe in SatisfactoryHelperV1/program/core/
2. Simply input your desired output rates in the boxes to the left, paired with item you desire. When ready, hit calculate.

__If you want to download the project__
- Download Satisfactory Helper - Project
- It was written in C# using VisualStudio and WindowsForms

__Currently not supported (but desired):__
- Specific building overclocking/downclocking.
- Changing item/building ratios. This is relevant if you're interesting power efficiency. For example achieving 30 ingots/min can be achieved with 1 or 2 (or more) machines, with each added machine improving efficiency, but this was too much to do for the time being.
- Related to the last point: setting an overall clock on a machine type.
- More (my brain is fried right now).
