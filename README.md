# iamLegend's Satisfactory Helper
## A helper for satisfactory calculations

__If you just want to run the program__
1. Download Satisfactory Helper V1
2. Run Satisfactory Helper.exe in SatisfactoryHelperV1/program/core/
3. Simply input your desired output rates in the boxes to the left, paired with item you desire. When ready, hit calculate.

__If you want to download the project__
- Download Satisfactory Helper - Project
- It was written in C# using VisualStudio and WindowsForms. You should be able to open the .sln and start editing/viewing it.

__Currently not supported (plan to include in future):__
- Specific building overclocking/downclocking. **_(In progress)_**
- Changing item/building ratios. This is relevant if you're interesting power efficiency. For example achieving 30 ingots/min can be achieved with 1 or 2 (or more) machines, with each added machine improving power efficiency, but this was too much to do for the time being.
- Related to the last point: setting an overall clock on a machine type.
- Alternative recipe options from HDD's
- Adding materials after tier 3
- Tree which shows heirarachy of buildings and where all their outputs go

__Changelog__
__V1.1 3/15/19__
- Added dynamic listing to allow for infinite items/buildings to be displayed
- QOL improvements
- Slight interface change
- Tooltips
